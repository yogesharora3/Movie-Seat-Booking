# Movie Seat Booking

#### UI displays movie selections and seats in a theater to choose from

### How it works -

- UI dispays the movie list , screen, seats and seat info.
- User can select a movie and its price
- User can select and deselect seats
- User can not select occupied seats

#### Number of seats and price will update as soon as user selects any movie

## Local Storage is being used to store the information about the number of seats and the number of seat you selected previously for particular movie
